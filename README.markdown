# NitroType Client

A simple JavaScript client for interacting with the unofficial NitroType API.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- A NitroType account

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nitrotype-client.git
   cd nitrotype-client
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Update `index.js` with your NitroType username, password, and desired user ID.

## Usage
Run the client:
```bash
node index.js
```

The client will log in to NitroType and fetch the profile data for the specified user ID.

## Notes
- Replace `YOUR_USERNAME`, `YOUR_PASSWORD`, and `USER_ID` in `index.js` with your actual credentials and target user ID.
- This client uses the unofficial NitroType API. Use it responsibly and at your own risk, as unauthorized API usage may violate NitroType's terms of service.
- For more endpoints, check the unofficial API documentation or existing projects like [nitrotype.js](https://github.com/ifvictr/nitrotype.js).

Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the client.
